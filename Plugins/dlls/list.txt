UnpackDFM 
=========
Event : PACK_UNPACK
API : FILE_PACK_UNPACK
A plugin for WinMerge which allows WinMerge to compare and merge Delphi's binary dfm files.

The plugin does nothing if it is passed a text-based dfm file. In this case, WinMerge will handle the 
comparison as normal.

Written in and for Borland Delphi 4 - because all dfm files are binary for this version of the compiler.

Requires the runtime library vcl40.bpl (in C:/windows/system32), which is part of the Delphi 4 setup. 
This is deliberate - I have no way to test the plugin on binary dfm files generated by higher versions of Delphi. If you want to usethis plugin for DFM files from >Delphi 4, I'd recommend recompiling it first.
