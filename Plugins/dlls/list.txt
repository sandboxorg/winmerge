RCLocalizationHelper
Preprocessing plugin for files .rc.
Use this plugin to compare two files localized in different languages.
It hides most differences concerning the localization (strings with localized
text, layout of controls in dialog). Missing strings/controls/menus
are displayed as differences.
TODO : localized strings tiled on two lines are displayed as different even
if present in both files. Should be displayed as ignored.
