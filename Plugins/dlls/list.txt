RCLocalizationHelper
====================
API : BUFFER_PREDIFF
Event : PREDIFFING
A plugin to merge .rc files localized in different languages. It hides most differences concerning the localization (strings with localized text, layout of controls in dialog). Missing strings/controls/menus 
are displayed as differences.
Option 'Ignore whitespace change' or 'Ignore all whitespace' is required.

TODO : localized strings tiled on two lines are displayed as different even if present in both files. 
Should be displayed as ignored.

UnpackDFM 
=========
API : FILE_PACK_UNPACK
Event : PACK_UNPACK
A plugin for WinMerge which allows WinMerge to compare and merge Delphi's binary dfm files.

The plugin does nothing if it is passed a text-based dfm file. In this case, WinMerge will handle the 
comparison as normal.

Written in and for Borland Delphi 4 - because all dfm files are binary for this version of the compiler.

Requires the runtime library vcl40.bpl, which is part of the Delphi 4 setup. This is deliberate - I have 
no way to test the plugin on binary dfm files generated by higher versions of Delphi. If you want to use
this plugin for DFM files from >Delphi 4, I'd recommend recompiling it first.
