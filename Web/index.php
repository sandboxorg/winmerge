<h2>WinMerge 2.0.2 - latest stable version</h2>
<p>WinMerge 2.0.2 is the latest stable version, and it is recommended for most users</p>
<p><a href="http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/winmerge/WinMergeSetup202.exe" target="_top">Download WinMerge 2.0.2 Installer</a></p>

<h2>WinMerge 2.1 - current development version</h2>
<p>WinMerge 2.1 is the development version, and is only recommended for users that can tolerate possibly losing their files once in a while, because we do not guarantee it to be stable.</p>
<p>On the other hand, this version has the latest and greatest features in WinMerge.</P>
<p><a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=13216&amp;release_id=199032" target="_top">Download WinMerge 2.1</a></p>

<h2>WinMerge 1.7 - older stable version</h2>
<p><a href="http://winmerge.sourceforge.net/WinMerge17/index.html" target="_top">WinMerge 1.7</a> is an older and simpler version, from before the integrated editor was introduced.</p>
<p><a href="http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/winmerge/WinMergeSetup.exe" target="_top">Download WinMerge 1.7 Installer</a></p>

<h2>Installation</h2>
<p>Just download the installer and double-click it.</p>
<p>Or you may simply unzip the binary zip package (eg, WinMerge202-exe.zip) into the desired location, and run
WinMerge.exe or WinMergeU.exe (the latter is the Unicode version, only for use on NT/2000/XP).</p>
