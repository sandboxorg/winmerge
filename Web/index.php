      <h2>WinMerge 2.0.2 - latest stable version</h2>
      <p>WinMerge 2.0.2 is the latest stable version, and it is recommended for most users</p>
      <p><a href="http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/winmerge/WinMergeSetup202.exe">Download WinMerge 2.0.2 Installer</a></p>

      <h2>WinMerge 2.1 - current development version</h2>
      <p>WinMerge 2.1 is the development version, and is only recommended for users that can tolerate possibly losing their files once in a while, because we do not guarantee it to be stable.</p>
      <p>On the other hand, this version has the latest and greatest features in WinMerge.</P>
      <p><a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=13216&amp;release_id=199032">Download WinMerge 2.1</a></p>

      <h2>WinMerge 1.7 - older stable version</h2>
      <p><a href="WinMerge17/index.html">WinMerge 1.7</a> is an older and simpler version, from before the integrated editor was introduced.</p>
      <p><a href="http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/winmerge/WinMergeSetup.exe">Download WinMerge 1.7 Installer</a></p>


    <h2>Installation</h2>
    <p>Just download the installer and double-click it.</p>

    <h2>Using WinMerge</h2>
    <p>You can use the <a href="docs20/index.html">online User's Guide</a>, or you can 
    <a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=13216&amp;package_id=11254">download</a> a copy.</p>

    <h2>Support</h2>
    <p>WinMerge is an Open Source project, that is covered
    under the <a href="http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html">GNU Public License</a>.
    As such, your main form of support for WinMerge will be through
    subscription to the <a href="http://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/winmerge-support">WinMerge-support mailing list</a>.
    In addition, SourceForge has bug tracking capabilities, so please report any
    bugs <a href="http://sourceforge.net/bugs/?group_id=13216">here</a>. Wish list items on the 
    <a href="http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=13216&amp;atid=363216">RFE list</a> will also be considered, but we make
    absolutely no promises.</p>

    <p>Here is the current <A href="WinMergeChanges.html">change history</a>.</p>

    <p>Since WinMerge is an Open Source project, you may use it free of charge.
    But please consider making a <a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/project_donations.php?group_id=13216">donation</a>
    to support the continued development of WinMerge.</p>

    <h2><a name="translate"></a>Localization</h2>
    <p>If you are interested in translating WinMerge's resources to your own native language,
    we'd be happy to provide you with the .RC file. All the resources are moved into a
    DLL, so it should be fairly straightforward to support most languages. 
    <a href="mailto:winmerge-support@lists.sourceforge.net">Let us know</a> if you're interested.
    We currently have WinMerge translated into the languages listed below. 
    To change languages, all you have to do is unzip the DLL in the same directory as WinMerge.exe,
    then select View / Language and choose your language. </p>

    <h2>Developers Needed!</h2>
    <p>One of the reasons WinMerge is on SourceForge is so other
    developers can get involved. If you have some free time, are
    proficient with DeveloperStudio 6 and MFC, and would like to contribute,
    then <a href="http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=13216&amp;atid=113216">check
    out the list of items to be done</a>. If you see something in there that you think
    you can handle, <a href="mailto:winmerge-support@lists.sourceforge.net">let us know</a>
    and we'll assign the item to you.
    Then grab a copy of the WinMerge source from
    <a href="http://sourceforge.net/cvs/?group_id=13216">anonymous CVS</a>
    or you can download a <a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=13216">zipped version</a> of the source,
    write your code, and then upload the changed code <a href="http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=13216&amp;atid=313216">as a patch</a>. 
    Then we will merge them back into the main codebase.</p>

    <p>If you do decide to join in, please follow these simple guidelines,
    which will ultimately make all our lives easier: </p>

    <ul>
      <li class="toc">Please consider that WinMerge is translated into 
        multiple languages, so it is always better to keep UI changes to a 
        minimum. Any addition of text to the UI means we have to go back 
        to the translators. 
      <li class="toc"><b>Do not </b>make trivial 
        changes to existing code, such as deleting blanks, consolidating 
        multi-line comments into single line comments, etc. This just adds 
        a bunch of needless differences to the code. Besides, if every 
        developer massaged the code to fit his/her style, it would be a 
        never-ending struggle 
      <li class="toc">Please try to match existing coding style as 
        much as possible 
      <li class="toc">Please make sure to comment your work so we can 
        all understand what you've done (even though I didn't ;-) ) 
      <li class="toc">Please don't make changes that don't relate to 
        the task at hand. If you come across other issues while handling a 
        task, please submit them as bugs or patches 
      <li class="toc">Please don't make changes that aren't on the task list or bug list;
        if everyone just threw in everything they wanted, the product would
        become a hodge-podge</li>
    </ul>

    <p>The general plan is to start people with anonymous CVS access and let the regular developers commit
    their changes to the CVS repository. Those developers that
    continue to contribute will be considered for read-write CVS access.<br>
    </p>

    <h2>WinMerge developers</h2>
    <p>This is a list of some of the current developers on WinMerge</p>

    <h2><a name="UsingWinCVS"></a>Using WinCVS</h2>
    <p>After much trial and error, I finally seem to have hit the sweet spot
    with WinCVS, and it works pretty well. To get access to the
    anonymous CVS server, do the following (note that this does not require SSH).</p>

    <ol>
      <li>Install <a href="http://www.wincvs.org">WinCVS 1.2</a>
      <li>Create a directory on your system that will 
        contain the WinMerge and Common repositories (I call it Merge on my 
        system) 
      <li>In WinCVS, select "Change Browse Location" from 
        the View menu and navigate to the directory you just created. Your 
        base folder should now appear in the left pane of the WinCVS main window 
        and should be selected. 
      <li>Select "Checkout module" from the Create menu 
      <li>Enter "WinMerge" (no quotes) in the "Enter 
        module name and path on the server" field. Note that 
        capitalization is important. 
      <li>Select the General tab 
      <li>Enter 
        ":pserver:anonymous@cvs.WinMerge.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/winmerge" in 
        the "Enter the CVSROOT" field (again, no quotes) 
      <li>Select "passwd file on the CVS server" in the 
        Authentication section 
      <li>Click OK. This should download a copy of 
        the source code into a subdirectory called WinMerge. 
      </ol>
