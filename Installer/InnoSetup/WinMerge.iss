; RCS ID line follows -- this is updated by CVS
; $Id$
;
;           Programmed by:  Christian Blackburn and Christian List
;                 Purpose:  The is the Inno Setup installation script for distributing our WinmMerge application.
; Tools Needed To Compile:  Inno Setup 4.18+ (http://www.jrsoftware.org/isdl.php), Inno Setup QuickStart Pack 4.18+(http://www.jrsoftware.org/isdl.php)
;                           note: the versions of Inno Setup and the QuickStart Pack should be identical to ensure proper function
;Directly Dependant Files:  Because this is an installer. It would be difficult to list and maintain each of the files referenced
;                           throughout the script in the header.  If you search this plain text script for a particular file in our CVS and it
;                           doesn't appear then this script is not directly dependant on that file.
;Compilation Instructions:  1.  Open this file in Inno Setup or ISTool
;                           2.  Make sure Compression=7Zip/Ultra, InternalCompressLevel=Ultra, and SolidCompression=True these values are lowered during
;                               development to speed up compilation, however at release we want the intaller to be as strong as possible.
;                           3.  Compile the script:
;                                   -From Inno Setup "Click "Build" --> "Compile"
;                                   -From ISTool Click "Project" --> "Compile Setup"
;                           4.  The compiled installer will appear in the \InnoSetup\Output\ directory at currently should be around 1.5MBs in size.
;
;Installer Todo List:
; #  Automatically detect and configure WinMerge to work with Visual Source Safe
; #  Make the Install7ZipDll() Function automatically work with future versions of Merge7zDLL
; #  Test and distribute the files contained within "MergePlugins (From 2140).7z" or in the folder MergePlugins of "WinMerge2140-exe.7z"
; #  Bundle 7-Zip with WinMerge or provide on the fly download capability.
; #  Automatically detect the user's locale, select, and install that language and the registry settings that would make that language be
;     the language on startup.
; #  Evaluate current default settings in WinMerge and bug those that don't make sense
; #  Create instructions and a sample language file using the Inno Setup Translator Tool (http://www2.arnes.si/~sopjsimo/translator.html)
; #  Add WinMerge is running would you like to close it now support with programmatic termination
;     -Note: I tried this with ISX and the extensions are innadequate I will have to use AutoIt 3.X instead
; #  Add WinMerge to the user's path so they can execute comparison's from a Dos Prompt (Cmd.exe/Command.exe)
; #   Make an uninstall icon and use it: UninstallIconFile=..\src\res\Merge.ico
; #  Make a Floppy Disk /Low Bandwidth Edition of the WinMerge Installer that doesn't include outdated (3.11, 3.12) 7-Zip Support or the Language files
;     If the user requires any of these we'll download it on the fly.  (maybe that should be the default behavior from the get go?)
; #  We need to look in the registry and (HKLM\...\Uninstall\Winmerge_is1) determine what the previous start
;     menu location was so that we can remove it if the user chooses to install to a different location.
; #  Determine whether NT 3.51 with a 3.0 or higher version of IE can run our application I don't want the system requirements
;     in \Docs\Read Me.RTF to be inaccurate.
; #  Create two info pages during installation one for our Contributors and a second one for our Read Me file.
;     If this isn't possible then we'll need to use ISPP and somehow programatically combine the two RTF files prior to compilation.
; #  While uninstalling prompt the user as to whether or not they'd like to remove their WinMerge preferences too?
; #  Rather than requiring users to restart we could just kill all intances of Explorer.exe, but we'll need to prompt the user first and restart it
;    once the ShellExtension.dll file has been added or removed.   Tell Kimmo to re-write to detect path from HKLM.
; #  Be dilegent about getting a higher resolution copy of the Users's Guide.ico source art from somebody
; #  If the user happens to have Syn Text Editor installed then we'll make that the default text editor rather than notepad.
; #  Set the order of icons within the start menu (we'll have to use a registry hack since Inno Setup doesn't yet have this level of granularity).
; #  Create a switch for the installer to unzip all of the included binaries as if it were a zip file.
; #  Perry wanted a Select All button to appear on the components page.  Let's just ask Jordan Russell or Martijn Laan if they'll do it :).
