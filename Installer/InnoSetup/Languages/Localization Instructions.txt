The .ISL or Inno Setup Language files files are in .ini format, which means you have a line that looks like this to translate:
SomeLabelName=I'm a label's text translate me

If a particular line doesn't already contain a period in it please don't add one, that means Inno Setup will add a period automatically.  If you add a period to that line, then there will be two of them.  

The other type of text you should never modify are variables and they come in two forms:
%1, %2, %3, etc...

or

[name], [mb], [name/ver], etc... 

The remainder of this file contains specific instructions for each localized language.  Please look for your language within this file.  If it's not listed here or you have any other questions please let Seier Blackburn know at MyPurchases@Yahoo.com.  

The following languages do not need translating:
Bulgarian, Chinese (Simplified), Chinese (Traditional), Czech, Danish, Dutch, French, German, Italian, Korean, Norwegian, Polish, Russian, and Swedish

Once you've translated your file.  Please add it to the CVS and submit it as a patch assigning it to Seier and categorizing it as an installer issue. 

The good news is not only will your translation be helpful to our project, but countless other installers will now speak your language.  I will be submitting all these translations to the Inno Setup project for inclusion :).
