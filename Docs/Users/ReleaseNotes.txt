WinMerge 2.7.6 Beta Release Notes
=================================
November 2007

== About This Release
[NOTE]
This is a development release of a WinMerge. This is *not* a stable release.
In general, beta releases are not meant for production use. Beta releases
should be usable in general, but they can contain bugs and unfinished
features.

This beta release is the last beta release before next 2.8 stable release.
Between this release and 2.8 stable release there will be only smaller
improvements and hopefully lots of bug fixes.

Compared to 2.6.x releases there are many improvements done for usability
of WinMerge. One huge improvement is the new localization system, which
allows a lot easier translation of WinMerge. Then there are many improved
dialogs and other features.

Please submit bug reports to our
https://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=13216&atid=113216[bug-tracker].

== What Is New in 2.7.6?

For a complete changelog, see the ChangeLog.txt in Docs folder in WinMerge
program folder.

=== New Localization System
The most important change in this release is the new localization system. The
new system is based on widely used PO files. PO files are text files that have
both original (English) text and translated text together. As PO files are
text files they are easy to edit. Also there is no anymore any kind of
compiling needed for updating the files. So one can just edit the file and
re-start WinMerge to test changes done.

See WinMerge's development wiki for more information about translations:
http://winmerge.org/Wiki/Translations[]

In short: PO files have replaced LANG files in Languages-subfolder.

=== Translations
Several translations were again updated. We expect things to improve with
translation statuses, as new system is so much easier to use.

New Croatian and Portuguese translations were added.
