  <para>This topic describes how WinMerge detects and displays differences within files, and demonstrates simple file comparing and merging operations.</para>

  <section>
    <title>Comparing files</title>

    <para>We usually compare two files that are related in some way, such as two versions that were edited at different times, or by different people. If you examine two such files you can usually see some similar areas, and also identify several types of differences: different characters and words, different lines, even entire blocks of text that are different. But trying to understanding all the differences between two files by scanning them in your favorite editor can be tedious and error-prone. Specialized difference/merging tools like WinMerge are designed make this work more systematic and efficient.</para>

    <para>For example, a spell checker is a difference utility that most people have used: it can systematically step you through a document, highlight words that are different from those in its dictionary, and help you resolve each spelling problem. However, looking only at characters and words is not an effective way to do more complicated comparisons: many text utilities use lines as the basic unit of comparison instead.</para>

    <para>WinMerge also uses lines as its basic unit of difference. Words and spaces are not treated individually in comparing and merging operations. To illustrate, consider two files that are identical except for one line that is different. If the two versions of the line have four words that are different and one version has an extra space, then we say that the file has one difference, not five.</para>

    <para>If it's quicker to compare lines than characters, sometimes it's also useful to treat an entire block of lines as a single difference, instead of comparing one line at a time. As we will see later, detecting multiple-line differences makes merging more efficient too.</para>

      <title>Simple compare operation</title>

      <para>This section offers a simple example that demonstrates how to compare line differences between two files in WinMerge:</para>

      <orderedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para>Using a text editor, create two files with the names and contents shown here, being careful to preserve the words and line breaks exactly:</para>

          <formalpara>
            <title>Fle1:</title>

            <para><screen>It's hard to compare words
and merge them. So instead 
WinMerge compares lines.
Believe it or else.</screen></para>
          </formalpara>

          <formalpara>
            <title>File2:</title>

            <para><screen>It's hard to compare words.
WinMerge compares lines.
Believe it or not.</screen></para>
          </formalpara>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>Start WinMerge. For example, double-click the <inlinemediaobject>
              <imageobject>
                <imagedata contentwidth="32" fileref="screenshots/wm_icon.png" />
              </imageobject>

              <textobject>
                <phrase>WinMerge desktop shortcut</phrase>
              </textobject>
            </inlinemediaobject> WinMerge desktop shortcut.</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>In the Select Files and Folders dialog, specify <filename>File1</filename> as the <guilabel>Left</guilabel> file and <filename>File2</filename> as the <guilabel>Right</guilabel> file, then click <guibutton>OK</guibutton>. The File Compare window displays the two files in the left and right pane, like this:</para>

          <mediaobject>
            <imageobject>
              <imagedata contentwidth="592" fileref="screenshots/missing_lines.png" />
            </imageobject>

            <textobject>
              <phrase>Compare Files screen shot</phrase>
            </textobject>
          </mediaobject>

          <para>The window elements are described in more detail in <link linkend="CompareFiles">Comparing Files</link>. Here are some features you should notice in this example:</para>

          <variablelist>
            <varlistentry>
              <term>Number of differences</term>

              <listitem>
                <para>The message in the status bar (at the bottom) tells you that two differences were detected. </para>
              </listitem>
            </varlistentry>

            <varlistentry>
              <term>Difference colors</term>

              <listitem>
                <para>WinMerge marks differences with various background colors (which you can configure in WinMerge options). The basic difference color is gold, by default. Within each line difference, WinMerge marks words and characters that are different with a lighter background color. Identical lines (like the third line in the example) are unmarked: they have white backgrounds.</para>
              </listitem>
            </varlistentry>

            <varlistentry>
              <term>Blank lines</term>

              <listitem>
                <para>Notice that in the left comparison pane, the second line has text: the other pane has a blank gray line in the same location. This blank line does not exist in the <filename>File2</filename> source file, so what is it doing in WinMerge?</para>

                <para>WinMerge inserts one or more gray blank lines in one version of a difference when the other version has more lines. These empty gray lines do not represent blank lines in the source file; they are only placeholders in the display. The purpose of placeholder lines is to keep the left and right versions of differences vertically aligned. Thus in our example, the text, <computeroutput>WinMerge compares lines</computeroutput>, appears side by side in the Comparison window, even though they are on different lines in the source files. This makes it easier to compare differences in WinMerge than in a conventional editor.</para>

                <tip>
                  <para>One consequence of the blank lines is that both panes in the File Compare window always display the same total number of lines, even if their source files do not.</para>
                </tip>
              </listitem>
            </varlistentry>
          </variablelist>

          <para>Now that you understand how WinMerge detects and displays differences, you can use the comparing functions effectively, as shown in the next steps.</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>Click <inlinemediaobject>
              <imageobject>
                <imagedata contentdepth="15" fileref="screenshots/currentdiff_btn.png" />
              </imageobject>

              <textobject>
                <phrase>Current Difference button</phrase>
              </textobject>
            </inlinemediaobject> <guibutton>Current Difference</guibutton> in the toolbar (or press <keycombo>
              <keycap>Alt</keycap>

              <keycap>Enter</keycap>
            </keycombo>). If this button is not enabled (for example, if your cursor is in a different line), click <inlinemediaobject>
              <imageobject>
                <imagedata contentdepth="15" fileref="screenshots/firstdiff_btn.png" />
              </imageobject>

              <textobject>
                <phrase>First Difference button</phrase>
              </textobject>
            </inlinemediaobject> First Difference (or press <keycombo>
              <keycap>Alt</keycap>

              <keycap>Home</keycap>
            </keycombo>) instead.</para>

          <para>When you select a difference, the two versions are loaded in the Diff pane. The Diff pane confirms which lines are included in a difference, and lets you examine them in isolation from the rest of the file. In our example, Difference 1 clearly has two lines.</para>

          <mediaobject>
            <imageobject>
              <imagedata contentwidth="573" fileref="screenshots/filecomp_diffpane1.png" />
            </imageobject>

            <textobject>
              <phrase>Compare Files Diff Pane</phrase>
            </textobject>
          </mediaobject>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>Click <inlinemediaobject>
              <imageobject>
                <imagedata contentdepth="15" fileref="screenshots/nextdiff_btn.png" />
              </imageobject>

              <textobject>
                <phrase>Current Difference button</phrase>
              </textobject>
            </inlinemediaobject> <guibutton>Next Difference</guibutton> in the toolbar (or click <keycombo>
              <keycap>Alt</keycap>

              <keycap>Enter</keycap>
            </keycombo>). This jumps over the identical line (which is not a difference) and selects the last line.</para>

          <para>You have reached the end of the file and had a chance to examine every difference. This was a trivial example — there were only two differences — and there are other ways to compare differences in WinMerge. But it demonstrates the efficiency of using the WinMerge navigation controls.</para>
        </listitem>
      </orderedlist>

  <section>
    <title>Merging files</title>

    <para>The purpose of merging is to combine changes from two files into one file. Merging extends the concepts and functions used in comparing operation: please read the preceding section before beginning this section. In addition to detecting differences between two file versions, we resolve the differences and save the result in a single <glossterm>target</glossterm> version.</para>

    <para>Merging files makes concurrent development possible, and it is a common task in team environments. For example, suppose you and another person want to add code to the same program file at the same time. You both begin with an identical copy of the file, but during development you create separate versions that are not identical. At some point, the two versions must be merged into one version that preserves the changes from each contributor. </para>

    <para>Merging can be prompted (or even initiated) by version control systems like Subversion and ClearCase. For example, your version control system might prevent you from submitting changes to its repository because of merge conflicts. A conflict can occur if someone else checked in a different version of the same file while you were working on your version, and the version control system was not able to automatically merge the differences. When that happens, you might need to merge the conflicting versions before trying again to contribute your version. Many systems have integrated difference and merge tools, but you might prefer to use WinMerge instead.</para>

    <para>Just as with comparing, you use WinMerge's toolbar controls (or keyboard shortcuts) to systematically step through the differences. Resolve each difference by copying either its left or right <glossterm>candidate</glossterm> to the other side. When you have resolved all the differences, WinMerge lets you know that all differences are resolved (the versions are identical), and you are done merging.</para>

    <section>
      <title>Simple merge operation</title>

      <para>This short exercise demonstrates how to use the controls in the File Compare window in a systematic way to merge the simple files shown earlier:</para>

            </inlinemediaobject> <guibutton>Copy Right</guibutton> to merge difference 1 from <filename>File1</filename> to <filename>File2</filename>. In <filename>File</filename>2, notice that the single difference line is replaced by the two lines from <filename>File1</filename>, and the gray blank line is now gone.</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>

              </textobject>
            </inlinemediaobject> <guibutton>Next Difference</guibutton> to select Difference 2. This is easier than finding and selecting the difference yourself. It's especially useful if you want to step through all differences without accidentally missing any.</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>

          <para>The message that the the files are identical tells you that the merge is complete:</para>

        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>Click <guibutton>OK</guibutton> to dismiss the message. The status Difference message changes from <computeroutput>Difference 1 of 1</computeroutput> to <computeroutput>identical</computeroutput>.</para>
        </listitem>

      </orderedlist>
    </section>

    <section>
      <title>Choosing a merge result file</title>

      <para>You control where your merge result is preserved. The WinMerge Compare window does not have a separate result pane, unlike some merge tools. So the simplest strategy is to save your changes in one or both source files. Press <keycombo>
          <keycap>Ctrl</keycap>

          <keycap>S</keycap>
        </keycombo> at any time to save the current changes to both files; alternatively, click <menuchoice>
          <guimenu>File</guimenu>

          <guimenuitem>Save Left</guimenuitem>
        </menuchoice> or <menuchoice>
          <guimenu>File</guimenu>

          <guimenuitem>Save Right</guimenuitem>
        </menuchoice> to save only one file.</para>

      <para>To write to a third file instead of either source file, use <menuchoice>
          <guimenu>File</guimenu>

          <guimenuitem>Save As</guimenuitem>
        </menuchoice>. For example, your target file might be the difference or conflict file generated by a version control system.</para>

      <para>Similarly, in the WinMerge command line, you can leave both source versions unchanged by using the optional <option>outputfile</option> argument, as described in <link linkend="CommandLine">Command Line</link>.</para>
