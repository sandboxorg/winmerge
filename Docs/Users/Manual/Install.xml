    <title>Running install program</title>
    <para>Install program asks location where WinMerge is installed, installs files, configures shell integration and adds WinMerge to <guimenu>Start</guimenu>-menu.</para>
  </sect2>
  <sect2>
    <title>Shell integration</title>
    <para>Choose "<guilabel>Enable Explorer context menu integration</guilabel>" from installer's additional features to install shell integration.</para>
    <para>If install program is not used, shell integration dll (<filename>ShellExtension.dll</filename>) must be registered separately. This is done by running <filename>register.bat</filename> from WinMerge directory.</para>
    <para>Updating shell integreation outside installer requires first uninstalling current version. Uninstalling can be done by running <filename>uninstall.bat</filename> from WinMerge directory. After that computer should be restarted so Windows completes uninstallation. Then new version can be installed like described above.</para>

    <title>7-Zip and archive support</title>
    <para>Archive file support in WinMerge requires 7-Zip. WinMerge installer does not install 7-Zip. 7-Zip installer can be downloaded from <ulink url="http://www.7-zip.org/">7-Zip.org</ulink>.</para>
    <para>WinMerge automatically detects installed 7-zip in system, there is no need to any configuration. But WinMerge supports only certain versions of 7-Zip. Please check 7-zip version compatibility from <filename>Read Me.rft</filename>-file. </para>
    <para>7-zip integration needs compatible <filename>Merge7z*.dll</filename> in WinMerge program directory. <filename>*</filename> comes from 7-zip version installed. For example 7-zip version 3.13 needs <filename>Merge7z313.dll</filename>. And if <filename>WinMergeU.exe</filename> (unicode version) is used, then "<filename>U</filename>" is also added to filename: <filename>Merge7z313U.dll</filename>. <filename>Merge7z*.dll</filename> files for compatible 7-zip versions are installed by WinMerge installer. If needed dll file is for some reason missing it can be copied to WinMerge directory, for example from zip-archive downloadable in WinMerge download page.</para>
    <para>If <filename>Merge7z*.dll</filename> file is missing, WinMerge informs user with message showing filename of needed file and recommended version of 7-zip. This message can also be opened from <guimenu>Help</guimenu>-menu item "<guisubmenu>Archive Support Disabled</guisubmenu>".</para>
