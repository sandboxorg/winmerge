<h3>Perry's patch process with MakePatchDir</h3>

<a href="readme-developers.html">Back to readme-developers</a>

<p>

Perry wrote a small program, which he is happy to share in source or binary form,
that he uses to generate patch directories. Here is his process:

<ul><li>
Update local cvs copy to ensure starting with most recent sources (optional).
</li><li>
Create a new directory for the patch, eg, "Somewhere\WinMerge\patches\new_nifty_patch"
</li><li>
Create a subdirectory called new_nifty_patch\original_all
and copy WinMerge and common directories into it. 
</li><li>
Copy this directory and rename the copy as new_nifty_patch\applied
</li><li>
Make changes to the code in the applied version and test until happy.
</li><li>
Run MakePatchDirs, and drag and drop the patch directory root 
(Somewhere\WinMerge\patches\new_nifty_patch) into the edit box, then push the Go button.
This wipes and regenerates the directories new_nifty_patch\original and new_nifty_patch\altered, which contain all files altered
in the applied version, and the corresponding original files. (This purely uses timestamps; 
it is not nearly as clever as WinMerge itself.)
</li><li>
Zip up the altered and original directories, and attach them to the patch. (I always
create the patch, then attach files afterwards, because SourceForge seems to always
lose attachments if they were attached when the patch is first created.)
</li></ul>

<p>
This process is optional; you are welcome to adopt it if you like. If you have 
a better system, please consider posting it on the developers forum so we may 
all potentially benefit.

<p>
I, Perry, like having the applied subdirectory around to rerun tests with, 
for a little while, and like having the altered and original subdirectories 
which I can compare with WinMerge :)
