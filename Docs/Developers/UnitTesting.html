<h2>Unit Testing</h2>
<p><i>Unit testing</i> means running automated tests for the certain block of
the code. These tests are run either by scripts or unit testing framework. The
result is a list os passed and/or failed tests.</p>

<p>Unit testing framework used with WinMerge development is the Google Test,
available from <a href"http://code.google.com/p/googletest/">
http://code.google.com/p/googletest/</a>. Other frameworks can be used when
need arises. However we don't want to use every known framework so the reason
for adding new framework needs to be good, like new technology or language
used that current framework does not support.</p>

<p>Earlier we tried to start using CppUnit but unfortunately even compiling
CppUnit seemed to be too hard for many people. And creating tests is just a
mess. So CppUnit usage is discouraged nowadays.</p>

<h3>Policy</h3>
<p><b>Existing unit tests must be run without errors.</b> For every error
there must be a known explanation. It is a good practice to document errors
into unit tests so others know what is going on. It is also recommended to
submit bug reports of failing tests if the fix is not imminent.</p>

<p>When changing the code which has unit tests, test must be always run before
the patch is submitted to patch tracker and before the patch is committed to
SVN. Possible known failures must be explained. Failing unit can be a blocker
preventing committing the patch.</p>

<p><b>Failing unit tests may be (and most likely are) blockers for the beta and
stable releases.</b> Experimental releases can be released with known errors.

<h3>Adding new tests</h3>
<p>Unit tests by nature rarely are and can be complete. Adding more tests and
improving current tests is highly encouraged. It is the easiest way to improve
WinMerge quality!</p>

<h4>Modfying existing tests</h4>
<p>There must be some care when altering existing tests though. It may be that
there was a reason the existing test were done as it was. If that reason is not
obvious, it is better to create new improved test and leave the old test
untouched.</p>

<p>Fixing a failing unit testing by modifying the test is highly questionable.
The test must be <i>buggy</i> for this to be allowed.</p>

<h2>Quick guide to Google Test</h2>

<p><i>Google Test</i> is an external library/framework that must be compiled
before using with unit tests.</p>

<h3>Unzip and compile Google Test library</h3>

<p>Unzip the Google Test sources to some folder. Pick a folder you can keep
around (not some temp folder) because you'll need the header files every time
you compile unit tests.</p>

<p>Open solution file <code>msvc\gtest.sln</code> to the Visual Studio.
Depending on Visual Studio version the project/solution file may need to be
updated for later version before usage. Visual Studio asks about the conversion
when opening the solution file.</p>

<p>Build the <i>Release</i> target of <i>gtest</i> project. You don't need to
build other projects or targets. Indeed, <i>rebuild all</i> for the solution
does not work. Some of the projects in the solution are unit tests for the
framework itself.</p>

<p>Copy the compiled <code>gtest.lib</code> file from <code>msvc\Release</code>
subfolder to <code>Testing\GoogleTest</code> - folder in WinMerge source tree.
</p>

<h3>Setup Visual Studio for Google Test</h3>

<p>As mentioned earlier Google Test header files are needed to compile the
tests. As the Google Test was unzipped to separate folder we must first tell
Visual Studio where to find those headers.</p>

<p>Add the <code>gtest-[version]\include</code> -folder to Visual Studio's
include file folders:

<ul>
  <li>Open Options -dialog in Visual Studio</li>
  <li>Select Projects and solutions</li>
  <li>Select VC++ Directories</li>
  <li>Select Include files</li>
  <li>Add <code>gtest-[version]\include</code> -folder as <b>LAST</b> folder in
    that list</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h3>Open the test project into Visual Studio and compile</h3>

<p>Open the testing project to Visual Studio (VS 2003 and later work) and
compile <i>Release</i> -target of the project.</p>

<h3>Run the tests</h3>

<p>Open the Command Prompt and CD to folder where executable were build,
usually <code>[projectname]/Release</code>.</p>

<h3>Run the executable.</h3>

<p>While the testing runs it prints progress information and info about
<i>passed</i>/<i>failed</i> tests.</p>
