"*"//2004/10/18 Jochen Tucht	Change generation of revision numbers to allow
//for arbitrary version numbers at any stage without affecting build number.
//Merge7z may now follow a WinMerge-like versioning policy, or just use same
//version numbers as WinMerge, yet provide a build number simply reflecting
//the number of changes recorded in this revision.txt.
//(Two extra "*" needed to yield a higher build number than with first approach)
